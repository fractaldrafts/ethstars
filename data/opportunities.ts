Our protocol enables seamless cross-chain communication and secures billions in cross-chain value, making security our top priority.</p><p>This bounty focuses on our core messaging protocol, endpoint contracts, Ultra Light Node (ULN) implementations, and application-layer contracts built on LayerZero. We\'re particularly interested in vulnerabilities that could lead to:</p><ul><li>Message forgery</li><li>Replay attacks</li><li>Endpoint manipulation</li><li>Unauthorized cross-chain actions</li></ul><p>Critical vulnerabilities affecting protocol security or enabling fund theft will receive maximum rewards. This includes issues in message validation, relayer incentives, endpoint security, and application-layer integrations. We\'re also interested in economic attacks, oracle manipulation, and protocol-level logic flaws.</p><p>White hat hackers and security researchers with proven track records are encouraged to participate. Submissions must include detailed vulnerability reports with proof-of-concept exploits, impact assessment, and recommended fixes. All submissions should follow responsible disclosure practices and must not be publicly disclosed until patched.</p><p>The bounty program runs until February 1, 2026, with continuous evaluation and rapid response to critical findings. Participants will receive detailed scope documentation, access to testnet environments, and direct communication channels with our security team. Rewards will be paid in USDC or USDT upon successful resolution of reported issues.</p>',
